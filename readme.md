# Convert Snowflake docs to pdf
This repository contains a simple Python program to convert any URL from `docs.snowflake.com` into a PDF. The program is intended for educational purposes, especially for those preparing for the Snowflake SnowPro certification. I created this tool to study offline when I am traveling, or want to study without my computer by printing the documentation. If you're on a similar learning journey, you may find this resource helpful.
