This repository contains a straightforward Python program designed to convert any URL from docs.snowflake.com into a PDF. The program is intended for educational purposes, especially for those preparing for the Snowflake SnowPro certification. I created this tool to study offline when I am traveling, study without my computer by  the printing of documentation for better understanding of concepts. If you're on a similar learning journey, you may find this resource helpful.
